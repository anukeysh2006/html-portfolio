<h1>WEB DEVELOPMENT COURSE</h1>
<hr>
<p>I learnt basic html by opting for a course in coursera handled by Prof.ANGELA YU.The thing i like about this course is that it is up to date with modern technologies .Usually projects are done only on the completion of course to get cerficatr but here projects are done sidde by side to get the course outcome in  a proper way.
  The cost is only 499/ and it is reasonable to apply for this course.<br>click the image and get the course
